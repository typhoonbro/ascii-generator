# ASCII Generator

Project meant to be a first contact with [Bun](https://bun.sh), a new all-in-one JavaScript runtime.

Simple web page which takes a searchParams in the url, for example:
`localhost:3000/text=HelloWorld`

And generates an ascii art using the [Figlet](https://www.npmjs.com/package/figlet) npm package.




This project was created using `bun init` in bun v1.1.1.  is a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime.
